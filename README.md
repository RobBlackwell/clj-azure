# clj-azure

A proof-of-concept Windows Azure SDK for Clojure developers.

DO NOT USE yet.

A work in progress. The core authentication works and there is a proof
of concept for listing blobs and containers.

Now also shows how to work with Windows Azure Media Services (using
OAuth token from ACS).

Contributions welcome.
